            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Steven Allan Spielberg KBE OMRI (born December 18, 1946) is an American filmmaker. He is considered one
                of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era and one of the most popular directors and producers
                in film history. He is also one of the co-founders of DreamWorks Studios.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                In a career spanning more than four decades, Spielberg's films have spanned many themes and genres.
                Spielberg's early science fiction and adventure films, such as Jaws (1975), Close Encounters of the
                Third Kind (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), were seen as
                archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing numerous
                humanistic issues such as the Holocaust, the transatlantic slave trade, civil rights, war, and
                terrorism in such films as The Color Purple (1985), Empire of the Sun (1987), Schindler's List (1993),
                Amistad (1997), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Munich (2005), War Horse (2011), Lincoln (2012), Bridge of
                Spies (2015), and The Post (2017). His other films include Jurassic Park (1993), A.I. Artificial
                Intelligence (2001), and War of the Worlds (2005).
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Spielberg won the Academy Award for Best Director for Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, as well
                as receiving five other nominations. Three of Spielberg's films—Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and
                Jurassic Park—achieved box office records and came to epitomize the blockbuster film. The unadjusted
                gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $9 billion worldwide, making him the highest-grossing
                director in history. His personal net worth is estimated to be more than $3 billion. He is also known
                for his long-standing associations with several actors, producers, and technicians, such as composer
                John Williams, who has composed music for all but three of Spielberg's films (The Color Purple, Bridge
                of Spies, and Ready Player One).
